# WebScreenShotTool
A python script that uses Selenium to take screenshots of basic enum pages like robots.txt. The script sets the zoom level, waits for the page to load, gets the response code, saves the screenshot, and adds text overlays. The main function takes a website URL as input and saves the screenshots in a timestamped folder.
